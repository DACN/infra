<title>Towards Public Geodata in Europe</title>

<h1>Why Europe Needs to provide its own Public Geodata.</h1>

<p>Last week, I asked my friend Norm Vine, a stalwart of the Open Source GIS community, if he could introduce me to someone at the US Geological Survey who might be prepared to make a public statement about public access to national mapping data being a good thing for the national economy. He seemed genuinely perplexed for a moment, as if I'd just asked him to put me in touch with a fish who might be prepared to make a public statement on about how water is a good thing for the marine ecology.</p> 

<p>In the United States, public access to geographic information, "geodata" for short, has always been taken for granted as part of the national heritage. Norm suggested that in the US, one of the reasons to have a government is to have good map data. George Washington himself was a surveyor and mapmaker. The interior of the North American continent was unknown to the colonists; in order to be able to establish autonomy in the face of the colonial powers, they had to create and share accurate spatial models of where they were.</p> 

<p>At that time, Europe was gripped by internecine quarrels over scarce and well-mapped resources; quarrels were translated into attempts to gain external resources to help defeat each other, by colonising space and resources available elsewhere. The different colonial powers treated the maps that they made and collected very differently. Philip II kept Spanish national mapping under lock and key; maps were powerful military technologies for both attack and defense, and thus kept as military secrets. The British Empire published its maps openly and they were reprinted widely. When one looks at the modern maps of Newfoundland, of the whole Eastern Seaboard, it is the British-applied names that have stayed with us to the present day.</p> 

<p>Modern Europe is a very different place; the colonies are gone, and in place of internal competition is the ideal of free trade in goods and free movement of citizens, a diplomatic association, and a co-prosperity zone. European governments work together through the tripartite structure that is the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers, to design common legislative standards that will allow, or oblige, national agencies to co-operate. The sharing of geographic data across borders is a keystone in how Europeans can collaboratively manage resources, create fairer governance structures, and contribute to each others' economic prosperity. </p>

<p>The National Mapping Agencies of Europe sometimes seem to be living in the colonial past. Public geodata is kept under lock and key, through copyright and commercial licensing terms that are prohibitive to ordinary citizens and free-time, free-software enthusiasts who want to undertake amateur GIS projects. Europe's governing agencies, especially those who collect census information and manage resource networks, find it hard to co-operate; they speak different languages, use different cadastral and spatial models, use different technology platforms and sets of standards internally. Europe's current loosely-joined spatial data infrastructures are is not just unpredictable, they're not even predictably unpredictable.</p>

<p>The proposed INSPIRE Directive on establishing a common spatial data infrastrcuture in Europe is the latest and greatest in a long series of initiatives undertaken by NMA representatives to try and fix some of these problems. INSPIRE aims to establish common standards for describing the physical world and the things in it, and to establish a framework across which different agencies which collect data can share data with one another. A common framework is something that Europe badly needs to maintain integrity.</p>

<p>The terms by which INSPIRE is being dictated, reflect the false dichotomy which has troubled the internal governance of the European Union very deeply over the last year. In the red corner, the "Anglo-Saxon economic liberalism", privatising public services that used to be managed by the state, whether or not the market will provide the same or the necessary level of service. In the blue corner, the "old-fashioned centrist socialism", maintaining state ownership of public support services, whether or not it makes functional or financial sense to do so.If the European debate has to be a question of taking sides, then the privatising and liberalising tendency is "winning". It is using market logic and protective market instruments to reinforce itself. Each time the INSPIRE Directive draft has gone to a new stage in the co-decision process, the thematic types of data that is covers decrease, and the options that the public will have even to view images of geodata, let alone get access to it and work with it in their own geographic information systems, is decreasing. The second reading of the INSPIRE Directive has a new emphasis on protecting the intellectual property rights of the agencies that collect and distribute public geodata.</p>

<p>National Mapping Agencies are under a lot of pressure to perform well financially on government spreadsheets; the data they collect, after all, has the power to generate an immense quantity of new economic value, in particular in the design of new kinds of intelligent transport systems for goods and for people. Europe's GALILEO project is touted mostly for the transformational potential it can effect on transportation systems. GALILEO is an good case for a "middle way" in providing all citizens access to a free, public service, overseen by government and maintained by private industrial efforts. There is a guarantee that GALILEO will provide a useful free signal, with ultra-high-accuracy signals available at a price for crucial infrastructural and safety-critical operations. GALILEO is also an attempt to lessen Europe's growing economic and social dependency on the GPS system provided by the US government and its military agencies. All the public domain mapping data that the people all over the world trying to build the new geospatial web - Landsat imagery, STRM terrain models, the GeoNET gazetteer of world placenames - is provided for free and in the public domain by the US government and its military agencies.</p>

<p>As Europe moves into the 21st Century, it needs to design a common spatial data infrastructure that works for all of its citizens. INSPIRE is not that infrastructure. The National Mapping Agencies who designed it are quite rightly fearful for their role, with increasingly viable commercial alternatives to the data they collect and provide on the one hand, and government pressure to privatise formerly state owned information infrastructure and gain short term profit from it on the other. INSPIRE does not reflect the full debate around, or the full potential in, spatial data infrastructures as a tremendous engine of research innovation, new kinds of economic activity, and a reformed practise of civic engineering.</p>

<p>So far the debate has been largely been polarized between "information wants to be free!" and "you get what you pay for!" (Roger Longhorn's strong voice of pragmatism has been a rare exception to this). There are plenty of alternative models that can exist; GALILEO indicates where a good one may be - the offering of generalised geodata, lower-accuracy but still usable for most applications, free to access and free for use by the public; while NMAs, or whatever kind of new agency succeeds them in the information market, can charge large commercial players for ultra-high-accuracy data and still find it possible to recoup some of their costs. Many tens of thousands of European academics, researchers, small business persons and open source software developers are crying out for public access to the geodata that describes their world, and have many new and accurate insights into how Europe can overcome the description problems inherent in having 25 different spatial models in as many different languages.</p>

<p>I started talking about this with Norm Vine, because I've been working with Benjamin Henrion of the Foundation for Free Information Infrastructures, who worked hard to roll back the Software Patents Directive that would have put the brakes on the potential for small businesses and academics in Europe to create their own software, on putting together a wiki website at which people can learn more about the history of INSPIRE, find out how to get involved in the lobbying process, and find others who consider INSPIRE to have been designed without proper public consultation, without consideration for the negative economic and social effects that it may have. We've also started a public petition to give to Members of the European Parliament, to urge them to look again at what must appear to most people outside of the Geographic Information Industry, to be a pretty obscure technical directive that can't possibly have as deep a social impact on how Europe is managed and governed as it is actually going to have. 

<p>If you're in Europe, please support this effort by signing the petition, talking to your non-GI friends about it and asking them to sign it too. If you're outside Europe, keep watching this space; the decisions made here and now about the next generation of spatial data infrastructure, may impact your rights to get access to public geodata describing the world around you, faster than you think.
