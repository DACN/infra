<h1>How can i help?</h1>

<h3>Help to demonstrate support</h3>

<p>Visit <a href="http://publicgeodata.org/">Public Geodata</a> to learn more about the proposed INSPIRE Directive estabilishing a spatial data infrastructure in Europe.</p>
<p><a href="manifesto.php">Open Access to State-collected Geospatial Data</a> sets out the case for open geodata. If you agree, please <a href="manifesto.php#signup"><b>sign up</b></a> to indicate your support for the statements it contains. 
</p>

<h3>Help to make maps</h3>

<p>If you're interested in helping on the practical mapmaking side, there are several <a href="projects.html">open mapping projects</a> which could do with help; people cycling around town with GPS units, and collaboratively editing maps.</p>
<h3>Help inform MPs and MEPs</h3>

<p>In the UK, the power to license geodata is in the hands of the Ordnance Survey; their remit is to make money. That decision is in the hands of the <a href="http://www.odpm.gov.uk/">ODPM</a> which 'owns' the OS as a Trading Fund. Write to your MP and help convince them that there are <a href="access.html">policy alternatives</a> which are beneficial to the economy and to society. </p>
<p>In the European Parliament, the <a href="http://space.frot.org/docs/inspire_directive.html">INSPIRE directive</a> on spatial data infrastructure in Europe is being rushed through without proper consultation, in the hands of a quangocracy of national mapping agencies. The licensing terms imposed will affect all our work on GIS and open geodata. Some <a href="http://okfn.org/wiki/OpenGeoDataLetter">points for a letter to an MEP</a> are offered.</p>
<p>Find your MP's and MEP's contact details at <a href="http://writetothem.com/">WriteToThem</a>.</p>
