<h4><a href="http://publicgeodata.org/Open_Letter">Open Letter regarding the INSPIRE Directive to the Members of the ENVI Committee in the European Parliament</a></h4>
<p>
<a href="http://publicgeodata.org/">Public Geodata</a> is an effort to raise awareness of the proposed <a href="http://publicgeodata.org/WhatIsInspire">INSPIRE Directive</a> that is going through second reading in the European Parliament now. As <a href="http://publicgeodata.org/Analysis_Of_INSPIRE_Text">INSPIRE's wording has been changed</a> as it passes through the legislative process, it's moved steading towards a policy stance based on intellectual property rights held over publically funded geodata by the state agencies that collect it. As well as the <a href="http://publicgeodata.org/Open_Letter">Open Letter</a> and the collective research resources on the site, there's a public <a href="http://petition.publicgeodata.org/">petition to amend or reject INSPIRE.</p> 

<p><a href="manifesto.php">Open Access to State-collected Geospatial Data</a> sets out the case for open geodata. Please read this document and <a href="manifesto.php#signup"><b>sign it</b></a> if you would like to show your support.

<p class="high"><b>What is 'geodata'?</b></p>
<p>Geodata is information with a spatial component. It might describe something physical - a street or coastline - or be related to something physical, such as a billing address. 70-80% of the information collected by government is spatial in nature.</p>
<p class="high"><b>What is 'open'?</b></p> 
<p>Open information is that which we have a right to freely use and redistribute works based on, without charge or restrictive copyright conditions. The <a href="http://creativearchive.bbc.co.uk/">BBC/Channel 4's Creative Archive</a> is an early venture of open publishing of state-funded information. 'Open' is a <a href="http://www.openknowledgefoundation.org/three_meanings_of_open.html">legal, technological and social condition</a>.</p>
<p class="high"> <b>Why Open Geodata?</b></p>
<p>Maps and spatial information are used in a host of civic and political applications. A small revolution in mapping tools and standards is enabling business innovation and future locative mobile services.</p>
<p>
 Geographic data underpins services such as <a href="http://writetothem.com/">http://writetothem.com/</a> and <a href="http://theyworkforyou.com/">http://theyworkforyou.com/</a> 
 </p>
<hr/>
<p>There are several <a href="projects.html">projects</a> in the UK collaborating to build free-of-copyright street level maps. Non-profits that have collaborated with the Ordnance Survey have proposed an <a href="access.html#license">non-profit open license</a> for use of UK mapping data, currently Crown Copyright and expensive to rent.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://okfn.org/wiki/OpenGeoData">Open Geodata</a> pages at <a href="http://okfn.org/">OKFN</a> provide some more context around spatial data, why it is important especially for government, and where it can justifiably be free or non-free.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.pledgebank.com/geodata/">pledge at Pledgebank</a> to support the <a href="manifesto.php">Open Geodata Manifesto</a> and to devote ten pounds to supporting open mapping projects in London and the development of open source collaborative mapping software. Alternatively you may donate directly via PayPal through the <a href="http://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a><br/>.
