<h1>Open Access to Geospatial Data</h1>

<h2>Access to public sector information should be a right.</h2>

<p>For public sector information to be exploited, it needs to be 
as widely available as possible. EU FOI laws heavily emphasise
geographic data; 75% of the information generated by government
has a spatial component.   </p>

<h2>With open geodata we can analyse public information better. </h2>

<p>Geographic data underpins civic services such as http://writetothem.com/ 
and http://theyworkforyou.com/ . In the US, grassroots electoral
mapping and campaign planning tools such as http://advokit.net/ 
depend on freely available geodata. </p>

<h2>Freely available public data generates more economic activity.</h2>

<p>Opening the data leads to increased competitiveness in the service 
market, particularly in the mobile arena, and encourages innovation.
</p>

<h2>The 'Commons' licensing model is a strong public good.</h2>

<p>An "Attribution-Sharealike" license would require the user to
redistribute updates to the data; a middle way between commercial 
ipventures and state funding can be found, without resorting to 
unitive data usage charges. 
</p>

<h2>The 'cost-recovery' user-pays model is a social failure.</h2>

<p>Over 50% of UK national mapping data sales are to government 
or government-funded organisations; a false economy of over 60M. 
Ordinary citizens and not-for-profit organisations can't afford
the current expensive data licenses, and are reduced to supplication.
