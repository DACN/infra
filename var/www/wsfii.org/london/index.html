					On the first weekend of October (1st and 2nd) the World Summit on Free Information Infrastructures is taking place in London. This event will bring together individuals and groups from across the world working on projects such as free wireless networking, free of copyright mapping and open hardware. It is also part of a larger season of events based around alternative approaches to knowledge production and access and timed to coincide with the UK's hosting of a pan-European Creative Economy conference.</p>
				<p>
					The event is open to all but we encourage you to register because space is limited. A small entrance fee of &pound;10 is planned to help pay for costs but concessions are available.
