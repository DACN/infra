This directory contains the files needed to be changed to deploy a basic Jetty
server on Ubuntu 10.x, supporting a Solr instance.

You should install the application WAR file in $JETTY_HOME/webapps.
$JETTY_HOME is usually /usr/share/jetty on Ubuntu.

Assuming the WAR file is called apache-solr-3.3.0.war, the files in this
directory must be symlinked to the locations given below:

    /etc/default/jetty -> ./jetty
    $JETTY_HOME/contexts/apache-solr-3.3.0.xml -> ./contexts/solr.xml

You should then be able to start jetty with:

    sudo /etc/init.d/jetty start
