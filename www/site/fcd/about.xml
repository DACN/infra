<h1>
	About Friends of the Creative Domain
</h1>

<h2>
	Background and Purpose
</h2>
<p>
	Friends of the Creative Domain was formed in mid 2004. Primarily created to encourage and support the BBC's efforts to make an open <a href="wiki/CreativeArchive">Creative Archive</a>. It brought together groups who have a stake in the archive such as artists, archivists, academics, educators, and of course the license paying general public.
</p>
<p>
	Since then it has retained its structure as a open community while the focus has evolved into a more general promotion of the public domain and of the creative commons.
</p>
