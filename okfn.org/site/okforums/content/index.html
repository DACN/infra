		Subject Matter
	</h2>
	<p>
		This forum will focus on 'open content', that is works such as books, music, and films which are provided under terms that allow for free access, redistribution and re-use.
	</p>
	<p>
		Open 'content' it would seem is everywhere what with Yahoo announcing there were over 50 million web pages licensed under Creative Commons, Microsoft teaming up with the British Library to digitize 100,000 out of copyright books (under the aegis of the Open Content Alliance), and the BBC piloting the Creative Archive project which will make large sections of its back catalogue available for free online.
	</p>
	<p>
		The forum provides a chance to discuss these dramatic changes as well as to ask important questions such as:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			What exactly does 'open' mean? Does it mean 'full' freedom to access, redistribute and re-use or are restrictions such as those in CC non-commercial licenses allowed?
		</li>
		<li>
			How should we promote the creation and distribution of open content?
		</li>
		<li>
			Who will be producing open content and how will it be funded?
		</li>
		<li>
			To what extent do monopoly rights such as copyright hinder, or help, the development of open content?
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>
		About the Forums
	</h2>
	<p>
		The purpose of the forums is, simply, to promote open knowledge, be that getting it, using it, or sharing it. They are a series of informal gatherings and while centred on the subject of open information/data they are flexible in form and content. They aim to bring together those <em>producing</em> and those <em>campaigning</em>, and to cover everything from software to the law. The sessions are usually held in the evenings in London and their format is to have talks by three or four different people followed by a general discussion.
