	<h2>
		About the Forum
	</h2>
	<p>
		This forum addresses the subject of 'civic' information such as:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Reportage of parliament events (e.g. Hansard) and the issue of Crown Copyright
		</li>
		<li>
			Parliamentary composition and voting
		</li>
		<li>
			Information on local government officials and activities
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The focus will be on both:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			projects and software that produce or make available such information
		</li>
		<li>
			the legal and social issues involved in obtaining and providing such information
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Lying behind all of these is that elusive goal of giving the public greater involvement in the democratic system and increasing the accountability of the government to its citizens.
	</p>
	<p>
		Among others giving brief talks will be Stefan Magdalinski of theyworkforyou.com, Francis Irving of publicwhip, Tom Steinberg of MySociety, Anno Mitchell of the BBC's iCan project, as well as the well-known copyfighter Cory Doctorow.
