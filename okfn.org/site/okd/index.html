		The Open Knowledge Definition
	</h1>
	
	<st:Section>
		<h2>
			Introduction
		</h2>
		<p>
			The <a href="definition.html">Open Knowledge Definition</a> (OKD) provides an answer to the question: what is open knowledge? It puts forward, in a simple and clear manner, principles that define open knowledge and which open knowledge licenses must satisfy.
		</p>
		<p>
			The concept of openness has already started to spread rapidly beyond its original roots  in academia and software. We already have 'open access' journals, open genetics, open geodata, open content etc. As the concept spreads so we are seeing a proliferation of licenses and a potential blurring of what is open and what is not.
		</p>
		<p>
			In such circumstances it is important to preserve compatibility, guard against dilution of the concept, and provide a common thread to this multitude of activities across a variety of disciplines. The definition, by providing clear set of criteria for openness, is an essential tool in achieving these ends.

		<h2>
			The Definition
		</h2>
		<p>
			The full definition is available <a href="definition.html">here</a>. It is reasonably substantial document but it can be summarized in a simple statement:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				A work is <strong>open</strong> if it is accessible, reproducible and re-usable without legal, social or technological restriction.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			The precise meaning of specific terms, for example the three kinds of restrictions, are fleshed out in the full document which sets forth several principles with which a license for a given work must comply if it is to be considered open (along with additional requirement that the work is <strong>made</strong> available - the right to redistribute a work you cannot access in the first place is of limited value!).
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Read the latest version of the  <a href="definition.html">Definition</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Read the <a href="../three_meanings_of_open.html">Three Meanings of Open</a> which gives an overview of what is meant by legal, social and technological restrictions.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>
			What the Definition is Not
		</h2>
		<p>
			It is worth noting a few things that the definition, and its associated project, are <strong>not</strong> intended to do:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The definition sets forth principles by which to judge whether a knowledge license is open, it does <strong>not</strong> seek to <strong>provide or recommend</strong> specific licenses.
			</li>
			<li>
				It seeks to <strong>complement not duplicate or replace</strong> existing work by groups such as Creative Commons or the Open Access movement. Its role is relatively narrow one of drawing out a common set of principles which often already exist, explicitly or implicitly, in existing projects or licenses.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>
			Participation
		</h2>
		<p>
			The open knowledge definition is itself developed in an open manner. There is a public discussion list, okfn-discuss, which you can join via this <a href="http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/okfn-discuss">web page</a>. There is also <a href="http://www.okfn.org/wiki/OpenKnowledgeDefinition">wiki space</a> for more substantial discussion, ongoing drafting and a survey of licenses.
