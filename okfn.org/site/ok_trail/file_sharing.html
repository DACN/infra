			The Current Situation - The System's Not Working
		</h2>
		<p>
			Currently it is illegal to download music and films for free over the
			internet. Nevertheless, many many people do so: an estimated 20 million in the
			US alone. A law that criminalises such a large section of the population calls
			for serious reconsideration.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Freely available artistic content is socially desirable, in fact, the only
			reason to prohibit the practice at all is that artists are currently compensated
			for their work by revenue derived from sales of music, usually in CD format, and
			the rise of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_sharing'>file-sharing</a>
			is perceived to be jeopardising this.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Attempts to discourage the practice are:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				Ineffectual: exhortations to 'say no to piracy'.
			</li>
		
			<li>
				Draconian: the prosecutions carried out by the 
				<a
				href='en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA'>Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) on children and students.
			</li>
		
			<li>
				Technologically debilitating: the use of <a
				href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management'> Digital Rights
				Management</a> (DRM) that greatly decreases interoperability of systems,
				prohibits fair and creative re-use of material and may infringe human
				rights.	
			</li>
			<li>
				Invasive of privacy: ISPs are required to divulge the identities of their clients, and the content industry is pushing for an obligation to disclose details and terminate contracts with <em>alleged</em> infingers - in other words you could be guilty until proven innocent.
			</li>
		</ul>

			Solutions
		</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>The Open Knowledge Foundation</strong>, following the suggestions of other academics and
			organisations, proposes a system whereby:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				all works of film or music for which an artist desires compensation are
				issued with a digital code;
			</li>
			<li>
				these works are registered with an expanded version of the Copyright
				Office, for a fee that would cover administrative costs, and then made freely
				available over the internet;
			</li>
			<li>
				the Copyright Office collect usage data; on the basis of which
			</li>
			<li>
				copyright owners are remunerated in proportion to popularity of their
				work.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			The money to reward artists would come from an increase in income tax, or,
			less efficiently but more plausibly, from a tax on the services used to access
			content, chiefly <a
			href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISP'>ISPs</a> (Internet Service Providers).
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Estimates for the US market give the required tax in the first year as 12%.
			Even if the figure for the UK turned out to be twice that, your monthly <abbr
			title='Internet Service Provider'> <a
			href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISP'>ISP</a></abbr> charge might rise from
			20 to 25 pounds, for all the free, legal, high-quality, ad-free films and
			music in the world.
		</p>

			<em>Would you pay?</em>
