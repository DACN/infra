			Introduction
		</h2>
		<p>
			The model of open collaboration pioneered by the Free and Open Source Software movements has proved inspirational and is now finding a wide variety of applications beyond the development of software.
		</p>	
		<p>
			Digital knowledge-sharing is rapid, accurate, and virtually free. More and more initiatives are exploiting this remarkable feature of the modern world by pooling their mental resources and increasing their knowledge base.	Here we briefly describe three of the most successful.

		<h2>
			Wikipedia
		</h2>
		<p>
			<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'><strong>Wikipedia</strong></a> is a gigantic collaborative encyclopedia. Since its inception in 2001, it has grown to 1.3 million articles in 190 languages, with almost half a million entries in the English-language edition. Anyone can post content, although it is subject to moderation. The site is fast becoming one of the chief knowledge repositories on the web, as people are drawn to its open and interactive format. The large number of users ensures a high quality of monitoring as specialists browse their own areas and engage in debate over content. The format has also spawned a number of sister projects, such as the <a href='http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wiktionary</a> and the<a href='http://species.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>  Wikispecies</a> database. <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia'>Read</a> a history of the Wikipedia project, including a frank discussion of its strengths and weaknesses.

			Human Genome Project
		</h2>
		<p>		
			<strong><a href='http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/home.shtml'>The Human Genome Project</a></strong> was a publicly-funded, international collaborative effort begun in 1990 to map the entire sequence of the human genome. It was agreed from the start that the data would be in the public domain; this was cast into doubt when in 1998 a company called Celera Genomics began working on the same project using a newer and faster but less reliable sequencing method. They intended to patent the genome if they got there first, but when this was declared illegal by President Clinton they began to collaborate with the public project. In April 2003 it was announced that the project was complete. Since then the idea of <a href='https://www.bioforge.net/'> open-source biotechnology</a> has flourished, enabling faster progress, less duplication of research, and easier access to data for less well-funded institutions.

		<h2>
			The Open Access Initiative
		</h2>
		<p>
			Academia has always flourished on the free exchange of ideas. With low-cost instant digital reproduction and transmission the internet promises to accelerate and democratise this process - a vital development at a time when academic budgets are being cut back and library facilities reduced, often with the explicit rationale that content is freely available online, even though this is not necessarily the case. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong><a href='www.eifl.net/boai/boai.html'>The Budapest Open Access Initiative</a></strong>, a project of the <a href='/www.soros.org/'>Open Society Institute</a>, is itself a network of researchers and academics from around the world committed to the goal of making research articles in all academic fields freely available on the internet. The Initiative is a model of collaboration, with a number of projects running in disparate areas of academia, united by their belief in free access to information.

		<h2>
			Position of the Open Knowledge Foundation
		</h2>
		<p>
			We believe that the potential of an <a href='/okd/'>open</a> approach to knowledge creation and dissemination is only beginning to be appreciated. The Open Knowledge Foundation's central aim is the development, promotion, and support of projects, communities and tools that foster access to, and creation of open knowledge. Specifically the Foundation provides direct support and a permanent home to a set of <a href='projects.html'>projects</a> each of which works on different aspects of open knowledge.
