			Introduction
		</h2>
	
		<p>
			Copyright is an example of an intellectual <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly'>monopoly</a> granted to authors to give them an incentive to create. (See <a href='think_again.html'>here</a> for more on the theory behind intellectual property.) Note that copyright is simply one means to an end, not an inalienable 'right', and that its history is short compared with the history of authorship - apart from <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly'>monopolies</a> on individual books such as the Bible, it appeared in England in the 18th Century as a result of disputes between booksellers (<em>not</em> authors). Nor is there any proof that it is necessary; in fact in the 19th Century, when America did not recognise copyright of works by foreign authors, writers such as Charles Dickens still made more from abundant books sold cheaply in America than they did from editions sold at four times the price in England.

		<h2>
			Continuous Extensions
		</h2>
		<p>
			The original framers of copyright law, both in this country and the United States, considered a term of fourteen years, with an optional second term of a further fourteen years, sufficient incentive to create. The periodic extensions of copyright since then are the result of lobbying by copyright holders who want to extend their 'free lunch' - more money for no extra creativity.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			A classic example is the 1998 <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTEA'>Copyright Term Extension Act</a> (CTEA) in the USA. This secured an extra twenty years of copyright protection for works created after 1922, bringing the total to the author's lifetime plus 70 years (or 95 years for corporate works). It is hard to see how this relates to the only socially beneficial purpose of copyright, namely to give authors an incentive to create, since after <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation'>depreciation</a> due to interest, any  dollar of royalties potentially earnt at the end of this new copyright term has a present value of $0.0012, yes, that's one tenth of a cent.

		<h2>
			The Power of Lobbying
		</h2>
		<p>
			Why then did the entertainment industry spend so much in lobbying for the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTEA'>CTEA</a>? Disney, a major lobbyist, was concerned because Mickey Mouse was due to enter the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain'>public domain</a>. They wanted the right to go on making a profit from something created in the twenties. Other pro-extensionists were Mary Bono, widow of singer-songwriter Sonny Bono, and the estate of George Gershwin. They wanted to continue to make money from the efforts of deceased relatives.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			There are two main reasons why this is a bad thing. Firstly, 'rent-seeking', making money from old work, stifles the incentive to create new work, which is the sole purpose of copyright. Secondly, 'one size fits all' copyright keeps <b>all work</b> out of the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain'>public domain</a> in order to protect a tiny minority of extremely successful copyrights. The <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTEA'>CTEA</a> prevented <b>any work</b> since 1923 from passing into the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain'>public domain</a>. So Mickey Mouse and the poems of Robert Frost stay locked away until 2019. But remember that 92% of work from the period is no longer commercially available. That means no-one is making money from it, but it is virtually impossible to find (and illegal to re-use creatively), since it cannot be posted on the net, because it remains copyrighted, protected for no reason, to no-one's benefit.

			Solutions
		</h2>
		
		<p>
			<strong>The Open Knowledge Foundation</strong>, along with other organisations,	supports, firstly, a reduction in the terms of copyright to more reasonable levels and, secondly, the reintroduction of registration. The copyright register would be a simple directory for those seeking permission to re-use copyrighted	material (currently often an arduous if not impossible task). An additional possibility that would have zero impact on the remuneration of artists would be to divide current copyright into two terms, with renewal of the second term dependant upon payment of a nominal fee. This would ensure that all work without commercial value would automatically pass into the <a
			href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain'>public domain</a>.
