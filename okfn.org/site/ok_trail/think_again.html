	<h1>Thinking Twice about Intellectual Property</h1>
	
	<st:TableOfContents />
	
	<st:Section>
		<h2>
			Two Types of Property
		</h2>
		<p>
			Extremists often argue that <a
			href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property'>intellectual property</a> (IP) is just like any other sort of property. This is the basis of their argument that current levels of intellectual property rights (IPR) are too low: the law protects physical property indefinitely, so why not intellectual property?
		</p>
		<p>
			But IP is <strong>not</strong> like physical property, in a fundamental way. If I give you an apple, I have one  apple fewer; if you steal my bicycle, I have to buy a new one. But if I tell you something, I don't automatically forget it; if you copy my idea, I still have the idea too. In economic terms IP is	'non-rivalrous', which means that it can be used by many people simultaneously.

		<h2>
			Benefits of Open Knowledge
		</h2>
		<p>	
			So, for the cost of transferring the information, knowledge can be shared between two people and neither is worse off. Indeed everyone in the world can share in an idea and it won't run out.
		</p>
		<p>
			This doesn't mean that people who come up with ideas have to give them away for free. Overwhelmingly what is marketed is the embodiment of an idea, not the idea itself, and there is a huge competitive advantage in being the first to market a product, or in having a really good design. 
		</p>
		<p>
			It is fashionable clothes, not the abstract designs for them, that bring in profit, and they continue to bring in profit without any form of intellectual property protection whatsoever. No one can patent the blueprint for a shirt or pair of trousers, or even a purple silk shirt or dark green flared corduruoy trousers, and it is the freedom to copy and adapt others' designs that keeps the fashion industry constantly innovating. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Academia has thrived without formal protection of ideas for centuries, the only protection being the strong human aversion to plagiarism. Ideas are freely exchanged and critics and scientists expect to build on one another's interpretations and discoveries. The patenting of ideas could prove disastrous to the future evolution of knowledge, yet this is already happening, at the cutting edge of biotechnology, for instance.
		</p>
		<p>
			Openness has huge benefits for society in terms of the spread and growth of knowledge. Contrast the situation where extensive monopolies are granted to inventors of ideas, products and so forth.

		<h2>
			Problems with Intellectual Property
		</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>IP hampers access to and diffusion of knowledge:</strong> naturally, since this is how profit can be protected, but restricted access is nonetheless a net loss to society, and should be kept to the minimum necessary. Furthermore our current 'one size fits all' approach to IPR means that access to a huge range of non-profitable ideas is also hampered by default. The commercial life of most books does not extend beyond a decade, at which point they will no longer be printed. They <em>will</em>, however, remain protected for at least sixty years more by a copyright law that serves no-one.</li>
				<li><strong>IP can hinder further creativity from the creator:</strong> if you record a huge hit at the age of twenty you could collect royalties until it's time to collect your pension - why bother to record anything else? This attitude, known as 'rent-seeking', is common in the history of IP, and it has the effect of stifling further innovation (exactly the opposite to its intended effect). James Watt patented his condensing steam engine in 1769; much of the next thirty years of his life was spent not in useful invention but in fighting lawsuits to suppress other people's improvements to his design.</li>
				<li><strong>IP can hinder further creativity from others:</strong> throughout history, people have built on the ideas of those before them. Science proceeds in this manner (see James Watt), as do art and literature. If IP had always been accorded the perpetual rights that physical property enjoys, West Side Story would infringe the copyright of Shakespeare's heirs and James Joyce would be sued by Homer's descendants. Less fantastically, blues and jazz, whose creativity often consists in re-working existing lyrical or melodic themes, could never have developed for fear of litigation. Hip-hop based on sampling faces a similar threat today.</li> 
				<li><strong>IP introduces a market inefficiency:</strong> in a pure market, the price of a non-rival good will tend to the marginal cost of its reproduction. Put another way, once an idea is created, it is not in short supply. The physical embodiments of it (books, or long-playing vinyl records) are in short supply because it costs to manufacture them, so it is the cost of copying that determines the price of a copy. Digital information transfer across networked computers is <em>extremely</em> cheap, so the true market price today would be almost nothing, and charging a price therefore creates an inefficiency.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>
			Why protect at all?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Given the large social costs of monopolies, particularly in the case of information and ideas, why would any society grant monopolies in this way?
		</p>
		<p> 
			Occasionally, due to high costs of innovation, it may in fact be socially desirable to grant a monopoly privilege to an inventor. This is because the monopoly allows the innovator to restrict access to the invention and raise the price, thereby (potentially) obtaining more money. Although this imposes costs on society, it provides an incentive for the original investment of time and effort.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example a new drug may require a great deal of expensive research and testing to develop. Without the guarantee of a monopoly on the good once it is finished, the company might be unlikely to risk the time and expense of producing it in the first place.
		</p>
		<p>
			Nevertheless, one should always be aware that even where a product or work requires a great deal of time or money to produce, monopoly exclusion rights are only one, imperfect, way to fund the endeavour. Many alternative funding methods exist, such as offering a prize, or having society pay directly for the necessary research or innovation. Consider the United States, whose pharmaceutical industry carries out more patent-funded R&amp;D than any other in the world. This vast spending is matched by that of the government and other organizations such as charitable foundations (whose money usually funds the creation of open, non-patented knowledge). Thus we see both methods of funding costly innovation and research used in roughly equal measure in a society which has, currently, one of the most extreme IP regimes in the world.

		<h2>
			Finding a balance
		</h2>
		<p>
			The incentive argument is an important one, but it doesn't follow that more IPR is therefore better. And when, as recently, it is suggested that copyright should be extended from 50 to 70 years beyond the author's death, transparently it cannot be the incentive argument that is being invoked. Rather we are in the realm of emotive arguments about 'rights', based on the flawed idea that one owns ideas in the same way as other property. It's vital to recognise that these are not 'rights' at all, but particular privileges, granted under a social contract, for a reason.
		</p>
		<p>
			That contract should be balanced for maximum benefit to society at large. Given the inevitable costs and distortions introduced by monopolies intellectual property rights should only be introduced when the incentives it provides are clearly superior to alternative funding methods such as prizes, subsidies, or direct support. When it is introduced it should, for the reasons given above, be set at the minimum level of protection that still affords the necessary incentive for innovation. This will of course be different in different areas (since it is more expensive to develop new medecines than to record a song).
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently, however, the debate is dominated by well-funded voices calling for extensions of IPR. The <strong>Open Knowledge Foundation</strong> seeks to redress the balance by focussing discussion on <em>socially optimal</em> levels of IP protection.
