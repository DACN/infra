			What is Open Source Software?
		</h2>
		<p>
			The <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source'>Open Source
			Software</a> (OSS) movement grew out of the <a
			href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software'>Free Software</a> movement, and
			continues to work alongside it. The decision was taken to replace the term
			'free' with 'open source' because of the ambiguity of 'free' (free as in free
			speech not as in free beer) and the anti-commercial connotations it held, but it
			ended up causing a mild philosophical schism. Free software advocates prefer to
			stress the freedom to modify and redistribute software, and operate a stricter
			license (so that all free software is open source, but not vice versa), while
			open source advocates say the essential element is unrestricted access to the
			source code.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			These distinctions are insignificant when we compare the two with <a
			href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software'>proprietary
			software</a>, such as that peddled by <a
			href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft'>Microsoft</a> or Apple. The sourcecode for these programs is heavily protected, and so all development is done
			in-house. It is important to recognise, however, that both open and proprietary
			software may be distributed at a cost or for free, and that some <a
			href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source'>open source software</a> is
			distributed free for the same commercial reasons as <a
			href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software'>proprietary
			software</a>. It isn't simply a case of the hippies vs the corporations.

		<h2>
			Why It Matters
		</h2>
		<p>
			What then are the advantages of <a
			href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source'>OSS</a>? Firstly, the open code
			means that anybody can modify the program to suit individual needs. Bugs are
			fixed much more quickly, because anyone competent can fix them, and the fix or
			'patch' is then freely available on the internet. Applications are improved by a
			process of common consensus: if something is good, it is retained, if not, it
			is dispensed with. Much <a
			href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source'>OSS</a> is 'cross-platform', ie
			it works on any <a
			href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system'>operating system</a>. This
			reduces the monopolistic <a
			href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in'>lock-in</a> characteristic of
			<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software'>proprietary
			software</a>, whereby one's freedom to choose the best software is severely
			limited by what will run on a given system.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The ease of sharing code over the internet allows <a
			href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source'>OSS</a> to harness incredible
			power and generate collaboration on a global scale: many thousands of
			contributors worked on the development of the <a
			href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RedHat_Linux'>Red Hat Linux</a> operating
			system, which, it has been estimated, embodies 8000 person-years of effort, or
			more than $1 billion in proprietary terms.
		</p>
		
		<p>	
			The <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source'>Open Source</a> model
			more closely reflects the underlying economics of software development. This
			millenium, over 90% of developers have been paid to come up with software that
			is specific to an organisation. This argues that the primary value of the
			software is to those who pay to have it developed, and there is therefore no
			compelling reason to protect the source code, or to restrict copying, which can
			be done at near-zero cost.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Furthermore, the low cost of <a
			href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source'>OSS</a> makes it ideal for use
			in developing nations. An example of this is the Simputer, a simple hand-held
			computer designed to bring mass computing to India. The Simputer Trust actively
			encourages <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source'>OSS</a> developers
			to port applications to its Linux operating system; the open code in turn allows
			local users to develop their own software. The boxes retail for $240.

		<h2>
			The Threats from Patent Extensions
		</h2>
		<p>
			Many <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source'>OSS</a> developers
			fear the influence of <a
			href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patent_debate'>software patents</a>,
			in force in the US and currently being proposed in the EU. Seemingly low
			standards for 'inventiveness' have led to a shower of patent grants, the
			build up of 'patent portfolios' held by software companies, and even the appearance
			of firms specialising in patent litigation. While many of the major software
			firms have signed truce deals with each other, <a
			href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source'>OSS</a> coders have no resources
			to fight legal battles with extremely well-funded corporations, and a number of
			projects have had to be abandoned or never undertaken, such as <a
			href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source'>OSS</a> applications handling
			MPEGs, JPEGs and Dolby files. The development of open Internet telephony
			software is severely hampered by a patent thicket allowing telephone companies
			to stifle innovation and promulgate their monopolies.

			The Position of the Open Knowledge Foundation
		</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>The Open Knowledge Foundation</strong> encourages the development and
			uptake of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source'>OSS</a>, and actively supports the campaign of the <a href="http://www.ffii.org/">Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure</a> against the introduction of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patent_debate'>software patents</a> in Europe.
