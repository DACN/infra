			Expensive Medicines, Cheap Lives
		</h2>
		<p>
			42 million people suffer from AIDS, 39 million of them in developing nations.
			The production cost for a year's supply of the anti-retroviral drugs that make
			AIDS a manageable disease rather than a death sentence is around $600, yet they
			retail in the US for $10,000 to $15,000. In Africa, India or China a vanishing
			minority have access to these drugs.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The reason for the exorbitant price tag is that the medicines are protected
			by <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent'>patents</a>. This makes it
			illegal to produce generic versions; the pharmaceutical companies argue that
			such cheap drugs would inevitably find their way back to rich nations and
			undermine the market for the full-price products, the sale of which funds the
			extremely expensive research and development of new medicines.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Now, <abbr title="Research and Development">R&amp;D</abbr> is expensive, and it needs to be funded by some method. But the
			current system is not focusing resources on the most pressing problems.
			Government-granted <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent'>patent</a>
			monopolies cause:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Exorbitant drug prices</strong> - hardly justifiable when pre-tax profits are often<a href='http://www.gsk.com/financial/reports/ar2004/annual-review-04/financial_statement.htm'>  twice the size</a> of budgets for <abbr title="Research and
				Development">R&amp;D</abbr>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Excessive marketing expenses</strong> and distortions in advertising campaigns masquerading as public information. 
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Wasted research into duplicative drugs</strong> - the Federal Drug Administration
				estimates that 67% of the drugs to which it grants patents do not improve
				significantly on their predecessors.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Neglect of research</strong> that is unlikely to
				lead to patentable drugs. 
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Excessive investment</strong> in
				non-essential drugs such as slimming pills.
			</li>
			<li>	
				<strong>Concealment of research findings</strong> 
				into the effects of established drugs as well as protection of	production secrets. Recently in
				the UK evidence was witheld about the suicidal side-effects in teenagers of one supposed
				anti-depressant while manufacturers were pressing doctors to start prescribing it to under-18s...

		<h2>
			Alternative Solutions
		</h2>
	
		<p>
			Where the pharmaceutical companies are culpable is in their negative attitude
			towards alternative mechanisms for <abbr title="Research and
			Development">R&amp;D</abbr>. Four have recently been proposed:
		</p>
	
		<ol>
			<li>
				Mandatory employer-based research fee to be distributed through
				intermediaries to researchers.
			</li>
			<li>
				Zero-cost compulsory licensing <a
				href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent'>patents</a>, in which the patent
				holder is compensated based on the rated quality of life improvement generated
				by the drug, and the extent of its use.
			</li>
			<li>
				An auction system in which the government purchases most drug <a
				href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent'>patents</a> and places them in the
				public domain.
			</li>
			<li>
				Financing pharmaceutical research through a set of competing publicly
				supported research centers.
			</li> 
		</ol>

		<h2>
			The Position of the Open Knowledge Foundation
		</h2>
		<p>
			The <strong>The Open Knowledge Foundation</strong> believes that this is an issue where the damaging effects of misguided IP laws and narrow-minded approaches to innovation have very real costs, costs that are measured in human lives. It is an area where international IP policy is determined by the interests of western multinational pharmaceutical companies while the costs are borne predominantly by the poor in the developing and developed world. We therefore strongly support the efforts and activities of the many individuals and NGOs working in this area such as <a href="http://www.msf.org/">Medecins San Frontieres</a> and James Love with the <a href="http://www.cptech.org/ip/health/">Health and IP programme</a> at CPTech.
